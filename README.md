# SCSS-lint Regex

I got tired of cleaning Sass codebases by hand to make them compliant with [SCSS-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) so I wrote a set of regular expressions to do just that. 

The point is to be able to perform a quick search and replace to make the whole codebase compliant to a specific rule from SCSS-lint â€” when possible of course. Turned out to be extremely easy in Sublime Text for instance (see following screenshot).

If you suspect a regular expression to be incorrect, dangerous or improvable, please by all mean open a new issue so we can discuss it!
